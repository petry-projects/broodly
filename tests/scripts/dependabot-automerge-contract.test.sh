# Test: .github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml keeps its locked contract.
#
# Why this exists: Fleet Monitor issues #469 and #472 flagged this workflow with
# a high failure rate. The failures were GitHub "startup failures" caused by the
# stub being truncated to its comment header on a sibling branch. Two generic
# guards (tests/scripts/workflow-integrity.test.sh and scripts/validate-workflows.sh)
# already reject a *structurally* broken workflow (missing on:/jobs:). They do
# NOT verify this file's *contract* — the exact invariants its own header marks
# "MUST NOT change":
#   - trigger must be `pull_request_target` (not `pull_request` or `push`)
#   - it must call the org reusable via `uses: petry-projects/.github/.github/
#     workflows/dependabot-automerge-reusable.yml@...`
#   - it must forward org secrets via `secrets: inherit`
#   - it must declare a job-level `permissions:` block (the reusable's gh API
#     calls fail without it)
# A drift in any of those would silently break auto-merge without tripping the
# structural guards. This test locks the contract for this one file.
#
# Run: bash tests/scripts/dependabot-automerge-contract.test.sh
